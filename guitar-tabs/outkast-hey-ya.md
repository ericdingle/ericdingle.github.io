    Lyrics
    
    One two three go!
    
    [Verse 1]
    My baby don't mess around me.
    Because she loves me so.
    And this I know for sure.
    But does she really wanna.
    But can't stand to see me
    Walk out the door..
    Don't try to fight the feelin'
    Because the thought alone is killing me right now.
    Thank God for mom and dad
    For sticking two together
    'Cause we don't know how.
    
    [Chorus]
    Hey Ya.
    Hey Ya.
    Hey Ya.
    Hey Ya.
    
    [Verse 2]
    You think you've got it
    Ohh, you think you've got it
    But got it just don't get it
    Til' there's nothing at all.
    We get together
    Ohh, we get together
    But seperate's always better when there's feelings involved.
    If what they say is "Nothing is forever".
    Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
    then what makes, what makes love the exception
    So why you, why you, why you, why you, why you 
    Are we so in denial?
    When you know we're not happy here.
    
    [Chorus]
    
    [Bridge]
    Hey, alright now fellows
    Now what's cooler than bein' cool? Ice Cold!
    I can't hear ya'
    I say what's cooler than bein' cool? Ice Cold!
    
    Alright, alright, alright, alright
    Alright, alright, alright, alright
    Alright, alright, alright, alright
    Alright, alright, alright, Ok now ladies!
    Yeah!
    Now we gonna break this thang down in just a few seconds
    Now don't have me break this thing down for nothin'
    Now I wanna see y'all on y'all baddest behavior
    Lend me some suga', I am your neighbour
    
    Shake it, shake, shake it, 
    Shake it, shake, shake it, 
    Shake it, shake, shake it, 
    Shake it,
    Shake it, shake, shake it, 
    Shake it like a Polaroid picture
    Hey Ya.
    
    Shake it, shake it, shake, 
    Shake it, shake it, shake, 
    Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, suga
    Shake it like a Polaroid picture
