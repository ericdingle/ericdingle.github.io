    <h1>Hey, I'm Eric</h1>
    <p>I used to have a blog where I'd write about news or concerts or movies that I went to, but
    it turns out the real reason I made the blog was because it was fun to code it. I actually
    really hated writing that kind of content! This site is meant to be a revamp of that, hopefully
    with content that I'm actually passionate about sharing with others.</p>
    <p>I've been a Software Engineer at Google for about 7 years, and I interned with Google before
    that. Over that time, I've worked on the likes of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Desktop">Desktop<a>,
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/o3d/">O3D</a>,
    <a href="https://toolbar.google.com/">Toolbar</a>,
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/">Chrome</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/google/sawbuck">Sawbuck</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/google/syzygy">Syzygy</a>, but my longest and current tenure is with
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/">Safe</a>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/">Browsing</a>. I focus primarily
    on fighting malware and abuse in the
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/">Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>
