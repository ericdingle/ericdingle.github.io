Computer graphics have always interested me, but I've never felt like I really understood the math
behind it. At one time, I bought a copy of the OpenGL Superbible thinking that I'd learn it inside
out, but it was slow going. Too much material to cover maybe. Fortunately, I was able to take a
graphics course in my 4th year at Waterloo, one of the three "dreaded" 4th year CS courses, but
I opted to take it anyway because I really wanted to know how it all worked. A semester of classes
and several projects, and I still feel like I'm a beginner :|

While taking that course, one of the projects was to create a ray tracer. I really, really liked
this project, but for some reason, I couldn't seem to find the source code that I'd written for it.
That was all good and well since rewriting it turned into this project. It implements a basic
ray tracing algorith with support for different objects, lights, materials and colors. I also added
anti-aliasing to create some nice, smooth edges.

Next step, photon mapping.
