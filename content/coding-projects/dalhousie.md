Legacy implementation of ericdingle.com.

I kept this source code around just because it felt weird to get rid of it entirely. I was big into
PHP at one time, and I really liked the MVC design paradigm (having suffered in prevous projects
where no design paradigm was used). I aimed to follow that paradigm pretty closely to make a well
designed (as in code structure) site.
