## About

I used to have a blog where I'd write about news or concerts or movies that I went to, but it turns
out the real reason I made the blog was because it was fun to code it. I actually really hated
writing that kind of content! This site is meant to be a revamp of that, hopefully with content that
I actually care about sharing with others.

I've been a Software Engineer at Google for about 7 years, and I interned with Google before that.
Over that time, I've worked on the likes of [Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Desktop),
[O3D](https://code.google.com/p/o3d/), [Toolbar](https://toolbar.google.com/),
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/), [Sawbuck](https://github.com/google/sawbuck) and
[Syzygy](https://github.com/google/syzygy), but my longest and current tenure is with
[Safe](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/)
[Browsing](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing/). I focus primarily on fighting
malware and abuse in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/).
