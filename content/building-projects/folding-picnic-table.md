I originally saw this project on [r/DIY](http://www.reddit.com/r/diy), and it quickly became clear
that I needed to build this for my own. It proved to be my most involved project yet. Luckily,
Chris' mitre saw was still sitting in my kitchen since I made the pallet wood planters last
summer... Better build something quick before giving it back!

The [blueprints](http://www.buildeazy.com/1pce2x4-1.php) are freely available, and that alleviated
the need to do any design which had taken up time in my previous projects. I picked up the materials
at Home Depot for less than $50, and found a weekend to get things going. In my true structured
fashion, I did all the straight cuts first, and followed by rounding out the pieces that needed it.
Lastly, I got to re-use my rotary rasp to make the hole for the bolt. After that, I basically just
followed the instructions other than a couple changes. First, I omitted the angle brackets because
I didn't think that they were really necessary (and they weren't). Second, I skipped the wood glue
because of laziness :)

I was pretty proud once it was all built, but the most time consuming and finger-aching part was
still to come. The sun was quickly darkening the color of the boards, so I spent another weekend
sanding everything down, and applying a couple coats of stain. The part would have been much easier
if I had done that to all the pieces beforehand, but then again that would have been more costly
if I made a mistake. Turned out pretty great in the end.
