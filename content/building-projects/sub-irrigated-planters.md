I can't remember exactly where I found this solution, but the main problem I was trying to solve
here was that I would often go away for a week or so at a time during the summer, and my plants
would suffer from my neighbors' lack of caring :| This meant that I needed an automated solution
for keeping my plantes hydrated!

The basic principle here is that a reservoir is added to the planter underneath the soil, and that
the soil will wick water up from the reservoir as the soil above it becomes dry. It's sort of hard
to imagine that this actually works, but it's similar to putting a wick in water or in oil for a
lamp. And after building these, I can assure you that it does indeed work!

This ended up being a pretty simple project. I replaced the landscape fabric in the planters with
a pond liner to prevent water from leaking from the bottom. I bought some perforated, corrugated
pipe to act as a reservoir, and I wrapped it in landscape fabric to prevent soil from getting in.
PVC pipe was used to add water to the reservoir, and a small plastic tubing was inserted through
the side of the planter and the pond liner to allow the reservoir to drain. After that, add soil
and plant as normal.

I was able to apply the same principle to the flower boxes, using coroplast as a means of creating
a separation between the water and the soil. That method worked pretty well too :) Unfortunately,
I didn't convert all of my planters so there's still some regular manual labour to be done. Maybe
I'll get them all converted next year.
