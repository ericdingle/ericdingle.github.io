I've slowly but surely expanded my balcony garden every summer since moving on to Clark. I started
first with flower boxes on the balcony railings, and then tried some vegetables in smart pots.
These eco-friendly pots are good, but they aren't really that big and they leave stains on the deck.
I decided that I could build some better planters that were raised off the deck.

Reading up online, it seemed like using pallet wood could be a cool and cheap idea, and would likely
give the planters the kind of look that I wanted. I ended up buying 4 or 5 off of Kijiji (though
I've since found some in the trash around the neighborhood), and I had an interesting adventure
getting the heavy suckers home from out near Lachine. Luckily, Nick leant me his SUV and helped me
get them up on my deck.

I disassembled them with a crowbar which was a bit of a pain in the ass, but that left me with a
good inventory of boards, both thick and thin. As for the plans, I drew a rough sketch and really
just tried to make as few cuts as possible (and props to Chris to letting me borrow his mitre saw).
The photo album shows the progression pretty well, and the result was better than expected :)
